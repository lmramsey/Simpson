# Simpson
## Simspon's Method Algoritom
The Simpson function is used to calculate the integral of a function across a set of truncated data points. The input values are 'x', a vector of the x values, and 'y', a vector of the y values. The output is "I", which is the integral value calulated with the simpsons rule. If the number of intervals is odd, a single trapiziodal rule will be applied.
